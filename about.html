						<h2>About Me</h2>
					</header>
					<p> Hello, thank you for visiting my personal website. I am a DevOps Engineer with a emphasis on operational tasks, while also collaborating with development teams in order to produce software products
						through a more efficient software development life cycle using CI/CD platforms. I hold a Bachelors degree in computer science software engineering from CSUMB (California State University of Monterey Bay), 
						with strong interests in DevOps Engineering, Software Engineering, Full Stack Design/Development, Automation Engineering, and Data Analytics. I have strong skills in several computer operating systems such as Mac, Windows, and Linux.
						I am an active learner with a growth mindset. With this mindset I am able to adjust to different environments and take on new challenges that I have never seen before. The technologies that I use on a daily basis
						consists of Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes, Ansible, Helm, CI/CD Pipelines, SonarQube, Nagios, Configuration Management, Server Operations and Web Development/Deployment. I keep my skills fresh and program with several different types
						of languages such as Python, C++, C#, Javascript, and Groovy. I am also interested in creating and improving full stack architectures while also making my projects secure and scalable with automation and machine learning.
						Please feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in what I do and have a position available.
